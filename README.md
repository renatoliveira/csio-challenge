# Salesforce Application Intake - Design & Implementation Exercise

Rely on Salesforce to validate the form structure through JSON serialization
Assuming that the lead and opportunity are the objects being created and that creation of other objects in the future (extending th feature) isn't required, but if it is it will be deferred to using record-triggered flows on these two entities instead.

## Realizations!

This test was about handling the generic "Object" with JSON deserialization, right?
